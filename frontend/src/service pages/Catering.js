            <h3>1. Plan Ahead</h3>
            <p>
              Starting your planning process early is key to a successful catering event. Aim to begin preparations at least six months in advance. This allows you to secure the best caterers, plan a menu that fits your theme, and coordinate all the necessary logistics.
            </p>
            <p>
              Define the goals of your catering event. Are you hosting a corporate lunch, a wedding reception, or a family gathering? Knowing the purpose will help you shape the menu, ambiance, and overall experience.
